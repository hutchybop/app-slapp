# 🛒 Shopping List Web App

A work-in-progress shopping list web application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **EJS**, and **MongoDB** (via Mongoose).  
It allows users to plan meals, generate shopping lists, and manage their weekly food shopping efficiently.

🔗 Test it live at: [https://slapp.longrunner.co.uk](https://slapp.longrunner.co.uk)
Note: If the website is down, I'm probably testing or updating it.
